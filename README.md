# ES101-Diesel-Electric-Locomotive-AutoDesk-Model
As part of the ES 101 - Engineering Graphics course at IIT Gandhinagar, our team developed a detailed Autodesk model of a Diesel-Electric Locomotive. This project focused on accurately modeling various components critical to the functioning of a locomotive. Below is a brief overview of the key parts included in the final design:

1. Body and Frame
The main structure supporting the entire locomotive, housing essential systems and providing structural integrity.

3. Engine
The diesel engine that converts fuel energy into mechanical energy to drive the locomotive.

4. Air Braking System
Ensures controlled braking, improving safety by managing air pressure to apply brakes smoothly.

5. Batteries
Provide the necessary electrical power to auxiliary systems and startup functions.

6. Electrical Generators
Convert mechanical energy from the engine into electrical energy to power the traction motors.

7. Bogie
The wheeled assembly that supports the weight of the locomotive and allows smooth movement on tracks.

8. Traction Motor Sand System
Powers the wheels by converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. The sand system improves wheel traction.

9. Turbocharging
Enhances engine performance by increasing the air intake, improving fuel efficiency and power output.

10. Crew Member's Area
A designated area for crew members, ensuring their comfort and safety during operations.

11. Water System
Manages water for cooling the engine and other operational needs.

12. Draft Gear
Absorbs shocks and vibrations during locomotive movement, protecting the frame and connected railcars.

13. Operator's Cab
The control center of the locomotive, where the operator manages and monitors the locomotive's operations.

14. Nose
The front part of the locomotive, designed for aerodynamics and housing auxiliary components.
